# Parser-AI
# ðŸ§  Sentence Parser and Noun Phrase Extractor

This project implements a natural language parser using context-free grammar (CFG) to analyze English sentence structure and extract noun phrase chunks. Built with Python 3.12 and powered by NLTK, this parser is designed as part of CS50â€™s AI course project.

## ðŸ“š Overview

Parsing helps computers understand sentence structure and meaning. In this project, we:
- Define CFG rules to represent valid sentence structures.
- Parse sentences to construct syntax trees.
- Identify noun phrase chunks â€” standalone noun phrases that donâ€™t contain nested noun phrases.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.12
- NLTK
